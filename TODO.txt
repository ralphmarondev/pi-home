- Make sure that the ground of the external power source is
  connected to the ground of the raspberry pi. Any ground
  pin will do. ^^

- One way communication, from dashboard [gui] to rpi,
  so when we click the button, and it is already turned on by
  the physical button, currently, it doesn't reflect to
  the ui, and it will think that it is currently turned off.
  Making the color changing not cute. Fix this soon!
